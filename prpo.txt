**Tech Stack Restriction:**
Only use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. No other file types or frameworks (e.g., React, PHP, JSX, etc.) are allowed.

**Provided Files:**
I have shared the complete project files, including `index.html` and `servers.html`.
You need to **rework only the `dashboard.html`** page. The rest of the site logic should remain untouched.

---

### ‚úÖ **Required Changes in `dashboard.html`:**

#### 1. **Sidebar Redesign**

* Remove the **profile picture, username, and logout button** from the sidebar.
* Replace it with the **website logo**, matching the style used in `index.html`.

#### 2. **Embed Builder > Embed Editor**

* Rename "Embed Builder" to **"Embed Editor"**.
* In the **preview section**:

  * Remove the **top color bar** from the embed (keep only the left color bar like in Discord).
  * Fix the issue of two separate embed boxes; merge them into one clean preview.
  * Move the **thumbnail** to the **top right** of the embed and keep it **fixed**.
  * Ensure the **footer always stays at the bottom** and does not appear between the embed.

#### 3. **Preview Toggle**

* Add a **toggle switch** to switch between **Preview mode** and **Code mode**.
* In Code mode:

  * Show a **JSON representation** of the Discord embed message (standard format).
  * Include a **"Copy Code"** button.

#### 4. **Embed Structure Flow**

* By default, show a **simple bot message box** only.
* Below it, add an **"Add Embed"** button.

  * On click, a new **placeholder embed** (styled like the preview) should be added.
  * If at least one embed exists, **move the "Add Embed" button to below the last embed**.
* Also include a **"Add Button"** dropdown below the last embed:

  * Provide all Discord button types (e.g., Primary, Link, Success, Danger).
  * Allow editing of placeholder properties like **label, color, style**, etc.
  * These buttons must also be included in the JSON output.

#### 5. **Save Function**

* On clicking **Save**, store the entire message (including embeds and buttons) in the database as:

```json
{
  embed_id: (random generated ID),
  content: (JSON message content),
  public: false,
  date_created: (timestamp),
  created_by: (user identifier)
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* Do **not** make any major layout or logic changes in:

  * or the rest of the site.
* Focus only on `dashboard.html` and embed editor logic.
